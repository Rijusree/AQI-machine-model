<h1>AQI Machine Model</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project basically focuses on <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preparation</b> for air quality of India</p>
<p>My work in this project is inspired from: 
<b><br><br>“Prediction of Air Quality Using Machine Learning”</b>
<br><br>Dr.Anupam Jamatia , NIT Agartala</p>
<p>The objective of this repository is not to claim a final prediction model, but to build a <b>clean, well-understood dataset and exploratory insights</b> that can support future machine learning models.</p>
<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<p>
  <li>Raw air quality data obtained from kaggal in xml</li>
  <li>Raw air quality data obtained from kaggal in xml</li>
  <li>Pollutants and indicators include (depending on dataset availability):

      PM2.5, PM10

      AQI

      Time-stamped observations</li>
